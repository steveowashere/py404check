# Python 404 Checker 

A simple Python 3 script to check if a website is down (404).

Provide a list of URLs and it does the rest!

Links containing Unicode will work. Make sure the .txt list is saved as UTF-8

The script will produce two output txt files. One with a list of the URLs found to be 404, one with list of URLs that have erroded for other reasons.
